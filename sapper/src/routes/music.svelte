    blurb="I helped run an open jam in Bergen County, NJ from 2012 to 2018. At its peak, we were drawing 10-30
            musicians and 30-50 people every Wednesday. This was one of the best things I've ever done. Almost every
            week, someone would come up to me and say, &ldquo;This is the only place I get to play with other people, thank
            you so much for doing this.&rdquo; The jams we recorded are up on archive.org, but I made a website just for it:
            <a href='https://www.pandajamfromhamsterdam.com'>pandajamfromhamsterdam.com</a>."

        blurb='My old instrumental jamtronica band, in operation for four amazing years from 2013 to 2017. We formed
                out of the open jam, and were heavily influenced by The Disco Biscuits, as well as funk and a bunch of
                other stuff. Check out the live stuff we have up at
