## About This Site

### Build
I do Javascript all day at work for well over a decade now. There's plenty I like and don't like about the language, but
honestly the thing I hate most is what the JS community has decided on as the "standard style". Rather than rant about
exactly why, I'm just going to include some links at the bottom of this section to stuff that's heavily
influenced my preferences.

So, that's why the builder for site is in Python. I've done a bunch of work with it and I think it nails everything
I want in an everyday language. For details on how this works, check out the 
[ReadMe](https://github.com/andybp85/andybp85.github.io). I'm also using real Sass, without the bleeping curly braces. I
swear it's like my industry has Stockholm Syndrome for noisy code... but I promised I wouldn't rant.

Will I write any JS for this site? I don't plan on it, but we shall see. It's definitely not going to be a SPA,
which I don't think actually makes for a great UX. I use [Clicky](https://clicky.com/) for less-sketchy analytics, so
there's the JS code for that, although I didn't write it. Maybe for some animations or something... but definitely not
for the kind of breaking-the-back-button behavior that's all the rage these days.

### Design

I have kind of a signature style for pages I've built, and my main idea is that a site should be simple enough that it
can look and work basically the same on desktop and mobile. It also has a light and dark mode, but you don't have to
click a button for it; it uses the media query to detect what you have your OS set to.

#### Fonts

I used a [type scale](https://type-scale.com/) based on perfect fourths for the sizing. I wanted to use the golden
ratio or perfect fifths, but the size gets too huge too quickly.

##### Headings: [B612](https://b612-font.com/)

This font was developed by AirBus to have high visibility on airplane cockpit screens, which is just about the coolest
thing I've ever heard about a font. I'd love to use it as a programming font (there's a monospace version), but the
parentheses look far too close to square brackets.

##### Body: [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)

I found this font from this [fascinating Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-readable-font-for-the-screen).
The site has some super interesting info as well.

##### Code: [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/)

Never thought I'd pay for a coding font, but I love its retro look, and I was able to get a 7 with a slash through it.
